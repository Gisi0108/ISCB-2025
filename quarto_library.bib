   abstract = {Forward stagewise estimation is a revived slow-brewing approach for model building that is particularly attractive in dealing with complex data structures for both its computational efficiency and its intrinsic connections with penalized estimation. Under the framework of generalized estimating equations, we study general stagewise estimation approaches that can handle clustered data and non-Gaussian/non-linear models in the presence of prior variable grouping structure. As the grouping structure is often not ideal in that even the important groups may contain irrelevant variables, the key is to simultaneously conduct group selection and within-group variable selection, that is, bi-level selection. We propose two approaches to address the challenge. The first is a bi-level stagewise estimating equations (BiSEE) approach, which is shown to correspond to the sparse group lasso penalized regression. The second is a hierarchical stagewise estimating equations (HiSEE) approach to handle more general hierarchical grouping structure, in which each stagewise estimation step itself is executed as a hierarchical selection process based on the grouping structure. Simulation studies show that BiSEE and HiSEE yield competitive model selection and predictive performance compared to existing approaches. We apply the proposed approaches to study the association between the suicide-related hospitalization rates of the 15-19 age group and the characteristics of the school districts in the State of Connecticut.},

   abstract = {We consider the penalized generalized estimating equations (GEEs) for analyzing longitudinal data with high-dimensional covariates, which often arise in microarray experiments and large-scale health studies. Existing high-dimensional regression procedures often assume independent data and rely on the likelihood function. Construction of a feasible joint likelihood function for high-dimensional longitudinal data is challenging, particularly for correlated discrete outcome data. The penalized GEE procedure only requires specifying the first two marginal moments and a working correlation structure. We establish the asymptotic theory in a high-dimensional framework where the number of covariates p(n) increases as the number of clusters n increases, and p(n) can reach the same order as n. One important feature of the new procedure is that the consistency of model selection holds even if the working correlation structure is misspecified. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method using Monte Carlo simulations and demonstrate its application using a yeast cell-cycle gene expression data set.},

Its purpose is to (1) choose an appropriate subset of potential covariates and their interactions, (2) to determine whether linear or more flexible functional forms are required to model the effects of the respective covariates, and (3) to estimate their shapes. Selection and regularization of the model terms is based on a novel spike-and-slab-type prior on coefficient groups associated with parametric and semi-parametric effects.},

abstract = {Abstract The stochastic search variable selection (SSVS), introduced by George and McCulloch[1], is one of the prominent Bayesian variable selection approaches for regression problems. Some of the basic principles of modern Bayesian variable selection methods were first introduced via the SSVS algorithm such as the use of a vector of variable inclusion indicators. SSVS can effectively search large model spaces, identifying the maximum a posteriori and median probability models, and also readily produce Bayesian model averaging estimates. A number of generalizations and extensions of the method have appeared in the statistical literature implementing SSVS to a variety of applications such as generalized linear models, contingency tables, time series data, and factor analysis.}
